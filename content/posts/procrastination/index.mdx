Procrastination is not a time management problem. It is an emotion regulation problem - we delay activities which might make us feel not-so-good today and in the near future. Berking's emotional regulation technique is a scientifically verified counter measure.

Behind procrastination, there is negative affect (thoughts, feelings, moods) about a particular task or the outcome of that task.

Sometimes it is related to a fear of failure, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, feelings of incompetence, etc. These hidden anxieties paint the task in negativity and we end up delaying the task. We participate in aversive tasks which make us feel better in the short term to cope with the negative mood induced by the task.

### **The proposed solution is emotional regulation.**

- Choose the task you procrastinate.
- Bring aversive and negative emotions & thoughts associated with the task into awareness.
- Instruct yourself to tolerate those negative emotions such as boredom, fear of failure, fear of judgment, feelings of incompetence, etc.
- Address those emotions by regulating your emotions in a structured manner. Begin with allowing those emotions to exist. Do not suppress them. Then tell yourself that you are strong, tough, and resilient. Finally, ascribe more emotional meaning to the task and emotionally commit to that task.

### The 2-Minute Rule

If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it right away. This will help you get a sense of accomplishment and momentum, and it will also prevent small tasks from snowballing into larger ones.

### The 5-Second Rule

When you find yourself procrastinating, count down from five to one. Once you reach one, get up and start working on the task. This will help you break the cycle of procrastination and get started on what you need to do.

Take a moment to imagine how you will feel if you procrastinate on a task. Will you feel stressed, anxious, or guilty? Now imagine how you will feel if you complete the task. Will you feel proud, relieved, or satisfied? Visualizing the positive outcomes of completing a task can help you motivate yourself to get started.

### Eisenhower Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix is a tool that can help you prioritize your tasks. It divides tasks into four categories:

1. **Urgent and Important**: These tasks are the most important and should be done first.
2. **Not Urgent and Important**: These tasks are important but not urgent, and they can be scheduled for a later time.
3. **Urgent and Not Important**: These tasks are not important but they are urgent, and they can be delegated to someone else.
4. **Not Urgent and Not Important**: These tasks are neither important nor urgent, and they can be eliminated.

### Eat the frog

**Eat the frog** is a metaphor for doing the most difficult task first. This is a good strategy because it gets the worst task out of the way and allows you to focus on the easier tasks later.

>Big projects = overwhelmed feelings = procrastination

Large tasks can be overwhelming, so it’s helpful to break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This will make the task seem less daunting and help you get started.

Perfectionism is a major cause of procrastination. If you’re constantly worried about making mistakes, you’ll never be able to get started on a task. It’s important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Your phone is a major distraction, so it’s best to put it in another room when you’re trying to focus on a task. This will help you avoid the temptation to check social media, email, or text messages.

## Flow State

Flow is a unique mental state of effortless engagement. Flow is more than just concentrating or paying attention. Psychologists go so far as to define flow as an altered state of consciousness with several defining features. Those in flow tend to feel so effortlessly engaged in a task that time seems to fly by. They are not easily distracted.      

In contrast with cycles of procrastination, when it can feel impossible to start an activity, during flow it can feel difficult to stop. Flow also tends to diminish feelings of worry or self-judgment, in turn fostering creativity. And people report experiencing a sense of oneness with what they’re doing, allowing for peak performance.     

### Things you can do to get into a flow

1. Do activities where you are intrinsically motivated i.e., things that you find purpose, meaning and enjoyment. This may include participating in a favorite hobby, but also tackling gratifying assignments at work, studying topics you find interesting, or even completing satisfying chores.
2. Balancing personal skill level with the activity's challenge is the key for finding flow. In other words, if a task is too easy, you may get distracted or feel bored. If it’s too challenging, you may become discouraged.
3. Have clear goals for activities and allow assessments/feedback along the way. Moment-to-moment feedback may be enough to motivate deep engagement.
4. Find a quiet environment free from distracting noises or devices
5. Break your tasks into small, specific segments that are easy to track and learn from
6. Set clear end goals that are challenging but not frustratingly so. If you find the task to be tedious, set additional parameters to up the stakes
7. Don't focus on reaching flow entirely. You can still get great work done without being in the flow.
