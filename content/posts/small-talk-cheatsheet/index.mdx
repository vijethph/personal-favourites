### **Basic Principles**

- Social skills and small talk are a skill you become better at by practice
- Small talk is a technique to get to know each other and get on the same level
- If you get on the same page, you can open up and connect more to create a relation
- Don’t engage people for approval, validation or acceptance - but for a social experience
- A big part of communication is nonverbal - voice, posture, expressions

### **Qualities**

- Be honest to yourself and others
- Be an energetic, optimistic, enthusiastic you
- Be curious and show empathy
- Don’t take it all too serious

### **Right mindsets**

- I can develop in a better me by taking action
- I’m the actor not the victim in my life
- I’m truly interested in other people
- Everybody likes me until proven otherwise

### **How to approach people**

- Look if people are open to conversation
  - Open body language
  - Not busy or in another conversation
- Make eye contact and smile warmly

- Approach and just simply open with:
  `"Hi, how are you?"`

### **How to start a conversation**

- Comment on the context (Situations, news, setting, people)
  `“This coffee place has a nice nostalgic interior, don’t you agree?”`

### **How to keep a conversation going**

- Balance talking and listening to 2:3 ratio

    - `“Why…”`
    - `“How come you chose…”`
- Avoid closed questions (limited answers; yes/no/…)
- Ask for opinions:
  `"What do you think about …."`
- Find common ground;
  - Agreement on an issue
  - Same interest \[hobby / career / etc\]
  - Knowing the same person

  - `“And then what?”`
  - `“What were you thinking when that happened?”`
- Ask about what has been told, go with the flow

- Practice, practice, practice

### **Stop!:**

## Takeaways from the book *How to Win Friends & Influence People*

1. Don't criticise, condemn or complain. Give honest and sincere appreciation. Arouse in the other person an eager want.
2. It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is among such individuals that all human failures spring.
3. Become genuinely interested in other people. Smile. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. 
4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. Talk in terms of the other person's interests. Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely. 
5. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong". If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. 
7. Begin in a friendly way, using praise and honest appreciation. Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately in a conversation. 
8. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking. Let them feel that the idea is theirs. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view. 
9. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. Appeal to the nobler motives. 
10. Dramatize your ideas. Throw down a challenge. Let the other person save face. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. 
11. An effective way to correct others' mistakes is to call attention to people's mistakes indirectly. 
12. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. 
13. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
