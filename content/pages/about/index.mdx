Hi!

I'm Vijeth.

I am a Software Engineer. I graduated from RNS Institute of Technology in 2021 with a degree of Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science.

My interests are in web development, solving programming problems and learning about new technologies.

When I am not coding, I love playing instrumental music with my keyboard, drawing, solving crossword puzzles.
