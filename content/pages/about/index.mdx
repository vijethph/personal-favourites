Hi!

I'm Vijeth.

I am a student at RNS Institute of Technology pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science.
I am interested in web development, solving programming problems and learning about new technologies.

When I am not coding, I love playing instrumental music with my keyboard, drawing, solving crossword puzzles.
